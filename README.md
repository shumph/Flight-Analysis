# Flight-Analysis
A python project I made during CS1026 at UWO, rather basic in form, not supposed to demonstrate the upper limit of my abillity but to show what I have been taught formally. The program 'analysis.py' contains a functions that parses through flight data(in CSV format), and a few more functions that analyze this newly parse data. The 'main.py' file exists to demonstrate the different functionalities of 'analysis.py'. I mad a voiceover for this program, so please use the link below if you wish to use it.
